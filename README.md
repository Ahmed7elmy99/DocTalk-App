# Doc_talk - Medicine Application - Graduation Project

DocTalk is Specialized Children's Learning and Rehabilitation App
 - An application designed to detect and treat speech problems in children through a multi-stage, multi-category approach.
## Features
 Includes surveys to assess each child's specific issues
 Structured in levels and categories, with each level having a series of story-based videos for the child to watch
 Children record words to practice pronunciation, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) technology
 Interactive quizzes in the form of games to evaluate the child's progress and unlock the next category
 Each level culminates in a difficulty-adjusted final quiz, with successful completion allowing the child to move to
the next level
 Comprehensive solution to identify, engage, and improve various learning and developmental needs in children
This project showcases expertise in mobile app development, educational content curation, speech and language
processing, gamification, and building adaptive learning platforms focused on child rehabilitation and growth.
